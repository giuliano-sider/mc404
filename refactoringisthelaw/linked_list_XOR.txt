The Linked List Strikes Back

// What follows is a lean implementation of a singly linked list starting with a sentinel node
// depends on a free store service. XOR list => may blow your mind
// note: 19 references to 'next' would have to be changed to turn this into an XOR list.      // plus, the 'FindKeyPosition' function would have to return 2 pointers, prev and pos nodes.
// and don't forget to maintain the tail pointer at the sentinel. Swapping head and tail at   // the sentinel effectively reverses the list (but keys will be in decreasing order then)

typedef struct List {
	int key;
	struct List *np;
} List;

FUNCTION:  LLCreateList @ List *LLCreateList ()
INPUT:
OUTPUT: r0 = > pointer to newly created list, or NIL it it couldn't be created
SIDE EFFECTS: Obtains a new list (a sentinel node) from the list freestore and returns a pointer to it. 
NOTE: Must maintain pointer to the sentinel node for the duration of the list's existence.

List *LLCreateList ()
	l = FreeStoreRetrieve( ListNodeFreeStoreHead )
	if l == NIL
		return NIL // no list obtained: the freestore is empty
	l.next = NIL // l.next === l.np for header (sentinel) nodes
	l.key = 0 // could be used as a tail pointer for an XOR list
	return l
End Function


FUNCTION: LLDeleteOrderedList: @ int LLDeleteOrderedList ( List * l )
INPUT: r0 = > pointer to head of linked list
OUTPUT: r0 = > 0 signals successful deletion, -1 otherwise. r1 = > pointer to error message if the routine is unsuccessful.
SIDE EFFECTS: Deletes all the nodes of a list, returning them to the freestore
NOTE: Assumes a list ordered by increasing keys.

int LLDeleteOrderedList ( List * l )
	if l == NIL
		Error: "no list has been passed"
		return -1 // unsuccessful deletion
	nextnode = l.np // next is np for header
	while nextnode != NIL
		LLRemoveOrderedKey ( l, nextnode, NULL ) // delete l.next, returning it to the freestore
	FreeStoreReturn ( ListNodeFreeStoreHead, l )
	return 0 // successful deletion
End Function
	

FUNCTION: LLRemoveOrderedKey: @ int LLRemoveOrderedKey ( List * l, int key, List **node )
INPUT: r0 = > pointer to head of linked list, r1 = > 32 bit integer key to be removed from the list, r2 = > pointer to node that is made to point to the removed item. if NIL, the node with the removed key is actually deleted by being returned to the freestore.
OUTPUT: r0 = > 0 signals successful removal, -1 otherwise (no list, no key). r1 = > pointer to error message if the routine is unsuccessful.
SIDE EFFECTS: Removes the node with the specified key from the list. If the third argument is NIL, the node is deleted by returning it to the freestore.
NOTE: Assumes a list ordered by increasing keys.

int LLRemoveOrderedKey ( List * l, int key, List **node )
	if l == NIL
		Error: "no list has been passed"
		return -1
	(nodebeforedeletion, nodedeletion) = LLFindOrderedKeyPosition ( l, key )
	if nodedeletion == NIL || nodedeletion.key != key
		Error: "key not found"
		return -1
	nodeafterdeletion = nodebeforedeletion XOR nodedeletion.np
	nodebeforedeletion.np = nodebeforedeletion.np XOR nodedeletion XOR nodeafterdeletion
	if nodeafterdeletion != NIL
		nodeafterdeletion.np = nodeafterdeletion.np XOR nodedeletion.np XOR nodebeforedeletion
	else
		l.key = nodebeforedeletion // we have a new tail to the list
	if node == NIL
		FreeStoreReturn ( ListNodeFreeStoreHead, nodedeletion )
	else 
		*node = nodedeletion
	return 0
End Function


FUNCTION: LLFindOrderedKeyPosition: 
@ List* LLFindOrderedKeyPosition ( List * l, int key )
INPUT: r0 = > pointer to head of linked list, r1 = > 32 bit integer key to be found in the list
OUTPUT: r0 = > pointer to the first node of the list whose next node has a key >= to key passed as a parameter, or node whose next is NIL if no such key is found. r1 = > pointer to first node whose key is >= to key passed as parameter, or NIL if no such key is found
SIDE EFFECTS:
NOTE: Assumes a list ordered by increasing keys.

List* LLFindOrderedKeyPosition ( List * l, int key )
	if l == NIL 
		return NIL // Error: "no list passed"
	currentnode = l
	nextnode = l.next // l.np === l.next
	while nextnode != NIL
		if nextnode.key >= key
			return ( currentnode, nextnode )
		t = currentnode
		currentnode = nextnode
		nextnode = nextnode.np XOR t
	return ( currentnode, nextnode )
End Function

FUNCTION: LLFindOrderedKey: 
@ int LLFindOrderedKey ( List * l, int key )
INPUT: r0 = > pointer to head of linked list, r1 = > integer key to be found in the list
OUTPUT: r0 = > 0 if key belongs to list, -1 otherwise
SIDE EFFECTS:
NOTE: Assumes a list ordered by increasing keys.

int LLFindOrderedKey ( List * l, int key )
	if l == NIL
		return -1 // error: "no list passed"
	(nodebeforekey, nodekey) = LLFindOrderedKeyPosition ( l, key )
	if nodekey == NIL || nodekey.key != key
		return -1
	return 0
End Function

FUNCTION: LLInsertOrderedKey: 
@ List* LLInsertOrderedKey ( List * l, int key, List **node )
INPUT: r0 = > pointer to head of linked list, r1 = > integer key to be found in the list,   r2 = > pointer to node that is inserted at the appropriate spot after being loaded with key; if NIL, the node to be inserted with key is actually allocated from the freestore.
OUTPUT: r0 = > pointer to inserted node, or NIL if insertion fails. r1 = > pointer to failure message
SIDE EFFECTS: A node is allocated from the freestore if node is NIL. Node is inserted, with key, at the proper position in the list.
NOTE: Assumes a list ordered by increasing keys.

List* LLInsertOrderedKey ( List * l, int key, List **node )
	if l == NIL
		Error "no list given"
		return NIL
	(beforeinsert, afterinsert) = LLFindOrderedKeyPosition( l, key )	
	if afterinsert != NIL && afterinsert.key == key
		error: "key already belongs to list"
		return NIL
	if node == NIL
		node = FreeStoreRetrieve ( ListNodeFreeStoreHead )
		if node == NIL
			error "failed to allocate"
			return NIL
	node.key = key
	if afterinsert == NIL
		l.key = node // update tail pointer of the list
	else
		afterinsert.np = afterinsert.np XOR beforeinsert XOR node
	node.np = beforeinsert XOR afterinsert // if this NIL you could update tail if necessary
	beforeinsert.np = beforeinsert.np XOR afterinsert XOR node
	return node // we blithely ignore typing in pseudo code (and assembly, for that matter)
End Function

// free store service:

FUNCTION: FreeStoreRetrieve 
@ List* FreeStoreRetrieve ( List ** freestorehead )
INPUT: r0 = > (address of) pointer to head of freestore
OUTPUT: r0 = > pointer to retrieved node or NIL if allocation is not possible.
SIDE EFFECTS: A node is allocated from the freestore if freestore not empty. Head is made to point to the next available item (or the end sentinel if none is available)
NOTE: Freestore items have the same structure as the list nodes

List* FreeStoreRetrieve ( List ** freestorehead )
	if (*freestorehead).next == NIL
		return NIL // sentinel node detected: free store empty
	node = *freestorehead
	*freestorehead = node.next

End Function


FUNCTION: FreeStoreReturn
@ FreeStoreReturn ( List ** freestorehead, List * node)
INPUT: r0 = > (address of) pointer to head of freestore, r1 = > node to be deleted
OUTPUT:
SIDE EFFECTS: A node is deleted by returning it to the freestore.
NOTE:

FreeStoreReturn ( List ** freestorehead, List * node)
	if node != NIL
		node.next = *freestorehead
		freestorehead = node

End Function
